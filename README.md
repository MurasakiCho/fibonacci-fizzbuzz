Fibonacci & FizzBuzz
==================

Fibonacci: 

The Fibonacci sequence is simply and recursively defined: the first two elements are `1`, and
every other element is equal to the sum of its two preceding elements. For example:

[1, 1] =>
[1, 1, 1 + 1]  => [1, 1, 2] =>
[1, 1, 2, 1 + 2] => [1, 1, 2, 3] =>
[1, 1, 2, 3, 2 + 3] => [1, 1, 2, 3, 5] =>
...etc
